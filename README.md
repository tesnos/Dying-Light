# Dying Light
A game!  That kinda sucks!  Did I mention it sucks?

Made for Ludum Dare 34 Jam

Here is the info, straight from the LD page:

In a world without lightbulbs, where the masked green figures have taken over and wish to plunge the world into an eternal darkness (literally) by destroying all the candles, and in theory, the sun (but I have no idea how).  The only thing left that can find it's way to the masked green figures boss, defeat him, and relight the candles is the last candle that is still burning (Were you expecting a name? Too bad. Candles don't have names).

Instructions:
You (the candle) go down the infinite path until you meet an enemy.  You then proceed to try and take him down so you can relight the candle he holds
hostage and relight it.  How much damage you do is based on how soon you press space after it shows up.

Tools Used:
 - Google Images (just for ideas, nothing actually taken)
 - paint.net
 - Python's built-in IDE (sue me, I can't find a one I like)
 - bfxr
 - abundant-music
 - Chiller Font
 - Pygame
